# Problem Statements

1. **Interactive Stadium Locator Map:**
   - Can we create an interactive map that allows users to search for stadiums by confederation, city, or country?
   - How can we make the map user-friendly and visually appealing?
   
2. **Stadium Capacity Analysis:**
   - What is the distribution of stadium capacities by confederation?
   - Are there significant variations in stadium sizes within each confederation?
   
3. **Country Comparison:**
   - Which countries have the highest and lowest average stadium capacities?
   - Is there a correlation between stadium capacity and a country's population or economic development?

4. **Home Team Analysis:**
   - Do certain home teams tend to play in stadiums with higher capacities?
   - Is there any correlation between stadium capacity and the performance of home teams in terms of wins, goals, or attendance?

5. **Population vs. Stadium Capacity:**
   - Is there a relationship between a country's population and the capacity of its stadiums?
   - Can we identify any outliers where countries have significantly larger or smaller stadiums compared to their population?

6. **Stadiums by Confederation:**
   - Which confederation has the most stadiums, and what is the average capacity within each confederation?
   - Are there any trends or differences in stadium distribution by confederation?

7. **City Stadiums Analysis:**
   - Which cities have the most football stadiums, and what is the average capacity in those cities?
   - Are there cities with a concentration of stadiums?

8. **Stadiums Over Time:**
   - How has the number and capacity of stadiums changed over the years?
   - Are there specific time periods when there was significant growth in stadium construction?

9. **Predictive Modeling:**
   - Can we build a predictive model to estimate stadium attendance based on stadium capacity, location, and other factors?
   - What variables have the most significant impact on attendance?

10. **Data Storytelling:**
    - How can we present the results of our analysis in a compelling and informative way?
    - What are the key takeaways and insights from the dataset, and how can we communicate them effectively?

11. **Stadiums and Olympics:**
    - Which stadiums in the dataset have hosted Olympic events, and what is their capacity?
    - Can we identify any patterns in stadium selection for Olympic events?

12. **Stadium and Economic Factors:**
    - Is there a correlation between stadium capacity and a country's GDP or economic development level?
    - How can we visualize and analyze this relationship?

13. **Stadiums and World Cup Hosts:**
    - Which stadiums have hosted FIFA World Cup matches, and what is their capacity?
    - Are there any recurring host stadiums or patterns in World Cup stadium selection?

These questions can serve as a starting point for your analysis and help you structure your exploration of the dataset for each of the project ideas. Depending on the insights you uncover, you may refine and expand these questions further.
